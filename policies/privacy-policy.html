    <h1>Privacy Policy for Soundboard Studio</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how the Soundboard Studio application uses permissions
        and processes data while you use the app.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Use of Microphone Permission (RECORD_AUDIO)</h2>
    <p>
        Our application requires access to the microphone solely for the purpose of recording
        custom audio clips directly within the app. This permission allows users to create
        their own soundboard buttons with recorded sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> The microphone is used only when the user explicitly
        starts a recording. The application never records audio in the background without
        your knowledge.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How Recordings Are Processed</h2>
    <p>
        All audio recordings created within the app are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stored locally</strong> – all recordings are saved exclusively on your device</li>
        <li><strong>Under your control</strong> – you can delete them at any time within the app</li>
        <li><strong>Private</strong> – recordings never leave your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. What We Do NOT Do</h2>
    <p>
        To protect your privacy, we explicitly state that the application:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>DOES NOT STORE</strong> recordings on external servers or in the cloud</li>
        <li><strong>DOES NOT COLLECT</strong> any personal data</li>
        <li><strong>DOES NOT SHARE</strong> recordings with third parties</li>
        <li><strong>DOES NOT SEND</strong> any analytics or tracking data</li>
        <li><strong>DOES NOT REQUIRE</strong> registration or account creation</li>
        <li><strong>DOES NOT INCLUDE</strong> third-party tracking tools</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        All data (including recordings, button settings, and preferences) is stored locally
        on your device. No data is transmitted over the internet.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        You have full control over your data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can revoke microphone permission at any time in your device settings</li>
        <li>You can delete any recordings directly within the app</li>
        <li>You can uninstall the app, which will remove all locally stored data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        If we make changes to how the application processes data, we will update this
        Privacy Policy and the “last updated” date. We recommend reviewing this page
        periodically for any changes.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>

    <p style="margin-top: 30px; padding-top: 20px; border-top: 1px solid #ddd; color: #7f8c8d;">
        <em>This Privacy Policy is designed to be simple, transparent, and compliant with
        Google Play Store requirements for applications that use the microphone permission.</em>
    </p>


    <h2>Advertising</h2>
<p>
    The application displays advertisements provided by third-party advertising services
    (such as Google AdMob).
</p>
<p>
    These services may use device identifiers (including the Advertising ID) to show ads
    that are relevant to the user.
</p>
<p>
    The application itself does not collect or store any personal data related to advertising.
    Any data used for advertising purposes is handled in accordance with the privacy policies
    of the advertising providers.
</p>
