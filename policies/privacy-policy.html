<h1>Privacy Policy for Soundboard Studio</h1>
<p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 2025</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how the Soundboard Studio application handles permissions
    and processes data during use of the app.
</p>

<h2>2. Use of Microphone Permission (RECORD_AUDIO)</h2>
<p>
    The application requires access to the microphone solely for the purpose of recording
    custom audio clips directly within the app. This allows users to create their own
    soundboard buttons using recorded sounds.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> The microphone is used only when the user explicitly starts
    a recording. The application does not record audio in the background.
</p>

<h2>3. Audio Recording Processing</h2>
<p>
    All audio recordings created within the application are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Stored locally</strong> on the user’s device only</li>
    <li><strong>Fully controlled by the user</strong> and can be deleted at any time</li>
    <li><strong>Private</strong> and never transmitted outside the device</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. What the Application Does NOT Do</h2>
<p>
    To protect user privacy, the application explicitly states that it:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Does not upload recordings to external servers or cloud services</li>
    <li>Does not collect personal data</li>
    <li>Does not share user data with third parties (except for advertising services as described below)</li>
    <li>Does not require user registration or account creation</li>
    <li>Does not include hidden background recording or tracking behavior</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Local Data Storage</h2>
<p>
    All data within the application, including audio recordings, button configurations,
    and user preferences, is stored locally on the device. No data is transmitted over the internet
    by the application itself.
</p>

<h2>6. User Control and Rights</h2>
<p>
    Users have full control over their data and permissions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Microphone permission can be revoked at any time via device settings</li>
    <li>Any recording can be deleted directly within the app</li>
    <li>Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. User-Generated Content</h2>
<p>
    The application allows users to download, import, or add their own audio content from
    external sources. The application does not control or monitor user-provided content.
</p>
<p>
    Users are solely responsible for ensuring that any content they add complies with
    applicable laws, including copyright regulations. The application does not include
    pre-installed content containing explicit, violent, or adult material.
</p>

<h2>8. Advertising</h2>
<p>
    The application displays advertisements provided by third-party advertising services,
    such as Google AdMob.
</p>
<p>
    These services may use device identifiers, including the Advertising ID, to display
    relevant or personalized advertisements.
</p>
<p>
    The application itself does not collect or store personal data for advertising purposes.
    Any data used for advertising is handled according to the privacy policies of the
    respective advertising providers. Users can opt out of personalized ads in their device
    settings.
</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
    If changes are made to how data is handled, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly.
    Users are encouraged to review this page periodically.
</p>

<h2>10. Contact</h2>
